DAC needs 5V to use full scane on gain 2 (0.000-4.096V)
for DAC 5V supply, level shift is needed on I2C, 10K pull up is good up to 400khz
RS232 peripherial? protection needed
DCDC converter cap size and capacity
inductor select
capacitors for opamps supply
low noise supply for opamps and analog parts
